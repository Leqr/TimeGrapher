# TimeGrapher
## Basic mechanical watch accuracy and fault detection software

Use tkinter, pyaudio, numpy and scipy in order to perform a time domain analysis of the watch sound to give the accuracy in s/day and the beat error in ms.

Can be used with an headphone microphone in a really silent environment or with a piezoelectric contact microphone.

GUI can be lauched by running :

     python3 sequentialTimeGrapher.py
